Welcome to the Github site of UNIX: The Textbook, 3rd edition!
Follow us at Twitter, @unixthetextbook

Here you will find In-Chapter Exercise Solutions (as ICE_Ch files), 
weblinks, and errata, all in Word .doc and .pdf formats.
Advisory information will be updated regularly, and will give
important changes in PC-BSD and Solaris since the printing of the book.
You will also find program source code in UNIX-compatible text
format here, so you don't have to type in program listings shown in the
printed book that are more than a few lines long!

If you follow the instructions in the printed book for Example
17.5, you will be able to "pull" everything from this Github site
to a git-enabled directory on your own computer! Alternatively,
you can just download the above-provided materials via a web
browser interface.

You can also report any errors you find in the printed book here.
Just email bobk48@gmail.com, and we will evaluate your error reports
or any other requests you make, and take appropriate action.

Advisory 3. Posted 10/30/16
We have updated the unixthetextbook3 repository so that it contains
both Word .doc and .pdf format files for everything except the
program source code, and this README.md file.

Advisory 2. Posted 10/22/16
Figure 23.16 in the printed book is now available in the ch23 folder
on this Github site. It is in a much larger format, and more readable
here than in the printed book. If there are any other figures in the
printed book that you would like to see here on this Github site, just
let us know by emailing the author at the email address shown above,
and we will try to put those figures as .jpegs in the appropriate
chapter on this site for downloading.

Advisory 1. Posted 10/19/16
PC-BSD has been "re-branded" TrueOS, but all of the material in the
printed book still works perfectly well. That's because, at this time, 
PC-BSD 10.3's(and earlier releases) website is still up and running.
If and when PC-BSD is replaced by TrueOS (probably not within the short
term, if their Forums commentary is any indication), we will notify you 
here at this Github site. 
TrueOS will be developed to the point where it is a one-for-one
replacement for the PC-BSD Desktop version, with of course some enhancements
not shown in the printed book. At that time we will post information
about those enhancements, and how they critically affect the content of
the 3rd edition. In the meanwhile-
Keep your eyes on the errata page (posted here as a Word .doc file), 
and any other Advisories we show here.

# Purpose:		To demonstrate working with numeric arrays
# Brief Description: Maintain running sum of numbers in a numeric variable called
# 			sum, starting with 0. Read the next array value and add 
# 			it to sum. When all elements have been read, stop and 
# 			display the answer.

# Initialize Fibonacci array to any number of Fibonacci numbers - first ten in this case

set Fibonacci = ( 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 )
@ size = $#Fibonacci	# Size of the Fibonacci array
@ index = 1			# Array index initialized to point to the first element
@ sum = 0			# Running sum initialized to 0
while ( $index <= $size )
    @ sum = $sum + $Fibonacci[$index]	# Update the running sum
    @ index++				# Increment array index by 1
end
echo "The sum of the given $#Fibonacci numbers is $sum." 
exit 0
